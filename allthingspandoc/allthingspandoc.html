<p>Hi! This page will help you understand pandoc and related
software.</p>
<p><strong>What is Pandoc?</strong></p>
<p>Pandoc is a universal document converter. It can take word docs and
convert them into markdown format or html. Pandoc is a very useful tool
when working with different file formats.</p>
<p><strong>How to Install Pandoc:</strong></p>
<p>To instal Pandoc you need to first download the correct package for
your computers operating system. The downloads and more installation
information can be found <a
href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use Pandoc to Convert From a markdown file to
HTML:</strong></p>
<p>Lets say you wanted to convert your newly written markdown file into
an HTML file for your website. You would need to do the following: 1.
Opening your terminal (on a mac this should be found in your
applications) 2. It can be helpful to make sure that pandoc is
installed. In your terminal window you can type
<code>pandoc --version</code> you should see something like
this:<code></code> pandoc 3.1.8</p>
<p>Features: +server +lua</p>
<p>Scripting engine: Lua 5.4</p>
<p>User data directory: /Users/jackie/.local/share/pandoc</p>

<code>3. Once you have done that you then need to make sure you are in your correct directory this is so that your computer has access  to the correct files that you are trying to convert. On a mac this can be done with the following:     1. `pwd` will tell you what your current working directory is.      2. `cd` will allow you to change directories      3. `ls` lists what files are in that current directories.      So lets say you have the markdown file on your desktop. You would want to do something like the following:</code>
jackie@Jackies-MacBook-Pro ~ % pwd /Users/jackie
jackie@Jackies-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd Desktop jackie@Jackies-MacBook-Pro
Desktop % pwd /Users/jackie/Desktop
``<code>That blurb shows that I am now working in my Desktop Directory.  4. From there you can use the following command to convert your document for macs:</code>filename.md
-o filename.html` this command can be done in reverse as well to go from
.html to .md and if this was all done correctly you should now see the
same file but in an html format. - For more detailed instructions see
the following <a
href="https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html">website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to Convert to a pdf format:</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pandoc on its own does not support pdf conversion. The
good new though is that there is software that you can use that works
with pandoc to convert to pdf format. The software that mac users can
use is called MacTeX. You can find the download page for MacTeX <a
href="https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html">here</a>. - You can
follow the installation process and show have successfully installed
what you need.<br />
- If everything is working correctly you should be able to follow the
steps above to be in the correct directory while using the following
command <code>pandoc filename.md -o filename.pdf</code> you should then
see your file as a pdf format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Pandoc is a very useful tool that you can use to convert files into
various other file formats. Pandoc has been useful to me in this project
for converting my markdown files into the html files that you see on the
website.</p>
