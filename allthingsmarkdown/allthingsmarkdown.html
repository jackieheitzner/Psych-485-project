<h1 id="all-things-markdown">All Things Markdown</h1>
<p>Hi! This page will help you understand markdown (md) text format and
Markdown software.</p>
<p><strong>What is Markdown?</strong></p>
<p>Markdown often abbreviated with (md) is a format of file that allows
users to write in a plain text format. More specifically by this I mean
that it is a format of written text that allows users to specify their
own formatting via markdown specific syntax.</p>
<p><strong>What is Markdown Syntax?</strong></p>
<p>Markdown syntax is a way of specifying how something should appear in
the document. This would take the form of bolding an item, underlining
something, or creating a header. For more specific information on
markdown syntax please see this <a
href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">handy guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Markdown versus Word</strong></p>
<p>The biggest difference between Markdown and Word is that Word makes
use of its own formatting and document styling in the word processor. It
also forces one to use the (.doc) ending for documents. On the other
hand Markdown is independent form any specific processor. This allows
you to use it across a variety of different platforms (Mac, Linux, PC)
without any risk of formatting issues.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use Markdown?</strong></p>
<p>For the sake of this project it was helpful to use Markdown to write
the bulk of the information because of the fact that Markdown is more
easily converted to HTML. This allowed me to convert my written files
into a format that could then be used as my website pages. If I were to
have written most of this in word I would have had to follow other steps
to get to the same point.</p>
<p><strong>For Those of You Scared to Switch</strong></p>
<p>I understand if you are a bit apprehensive to switch to something
like markdown from word or google docs. However, I will mention that a
semi-popular note taking software called obsidian exists that is free to
use. Obsidian makes markdown more user friendly and allows you to add
plugins that can customize your interface and note-taking experience.
See this <a href="https://obsidian.md/">page</a> on Obsidian for more
information.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In summary, markdown is a type of document that allows you to write
in a plain text format, and specify your own formatting via markdown
syntax. Markdown can be very useful for creating and editing web page
documents. It is also very helpful for those who would like to move away
from program dependent formats. I would suggest that you take some time
to explore markdown as it is a good format of text to be familiar
with.</p>
