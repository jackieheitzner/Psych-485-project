<p>This project has been about learning skills that are relevant and
useful for undergraduate students.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this skill this website makes use of the following
elements: 1. Github pages and repositories. 2. Markdown (md) text format
and Markdown software. 3. Pandoc and mactex for the ability to convert
documents from one format to another. 4. Citation software
integration.</p>
<p>Once I was able to learn these skills my general knowledge about how
some of these processes work on a deeper level was enhanced.</p>
