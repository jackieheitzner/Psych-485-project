Hi this page will help you get started with how to achieve all this!

The first thing that you need to do to get started is to create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) I would recommend using your school (@uwaterloo.ca) email as there are special educational perks allotted to you. 

**What is GitHub?**

GitHub is an online platform that allows individuals to share and create repositories of data. More commonly GitHub is used in the software development world as a way to share code and projects. 

For our purposes we will be using GitHub as the platform for hosting our website. An example of a website is my own [personal one](https://jackieheitzner.github.io/).

**What is a repository?**

It is also important for you to know what a repository is. A repository in essence is a space to store files, documents, or other things. If you are a mac user you could consider your "folders" as their own repositories. For a more detailed explanation as to what a repository is you can visit GitHub's page on [repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories).

**How to create a repository**

Once you have created a GitHub account it is useful to create your own repository. You can name your repository anything you would like. After you create your repository you can start adding files and making changes. 

**Offline or Online?**

When using GitHub you have a few options for how you would like to access your repositories. If you prefer working online you can simply access your repositories from any web browser. However, you do have the option of working offline on your desktop computer. This is probably best done by using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). GitHub Desktop lets you make changes on your computer and then "push" them to your online repository. I personally prefer to use github desktop for larger edits. 

**Creating a repository for your website**

If you are wanting to create a personal website It is helpful to name your repository after your GitHub account name followed by ".github.io". This can be seen with my own repository for my [website](https://github.com/jackieheitzner/jackieheitzner.github.io). Since my username is "jackieheitzner" I named my repository after this with the suffix. So in summary if you are wanting to create a repository for your website you would have "jackieheitzner.github.io" or in general "yourusername.github.io".

**GitHub Pages**

To create your own website GitHub makes use of what they call [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) this is free and uses a site builder called Jekyll. Your GitHub page is based off your own repository as referenced in the previous section. For more detailed information on how to create your personal github page you can reference this [page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

**Themes for GitHub Pages**

You might notice that my website has an overall feel and layout. This is done by using a theme template for my page. There are many that exist online for you to use. My website makes use of the template from [academic pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). Some other templates you might like are one that looks like a [resume](https://resume-template.joelglovier.com/), a more [blog feel](https://hugo-theme-itheme.netlify.app/), and [another one](https://atega-hugo.netlify.app/). I have not personally used these but they are worth taking a look into if you like them better than the one I use. 

To start using the academic pages one, you first need to "fork" the repository. This lets you create a copy of the repository for your own use that you can then edit and change without affecting the original repository. 

**Conclusion**

In summary my website makes use of 2 different repositories. The [repository](https://github.com/jackieheitzner/jackieheitzner.github.io) I based my website off of, and the [repository](https://github.com/jackieheitzner/Psych-485-project) that I have used to host the information for this project. To get to this point you need to have a GitHub account, and a repository from which to host your GitHub page from.
