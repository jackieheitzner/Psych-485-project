This project has been about learning skills that are relevant and useful for undergraduate students. 

To demonstrate this skill this website makes use of the following elements:
1. Github pages and repositories.
2. Markdown (md) text format and Markdown software.
3. Pandoc and mactex for the ability to convert documents from one format to another.
4. Citation software integration.

Once I was able to learn these skills my general knowledge about how some of these processes work on a deeper level was enhanced.
